        <h1>
            The <strong class="an"></strong> and the <strong class="an-an"></strong>.
        </h1>

        <h2>A <strong class="an"></strong> was making fun of the  <strong class="an-an"></strong> one day for being so slow.</h2>

        <h3>"Do you ever get anywhere?"he asked with a mocking laugh.</h3>
        <p>
            " <strong class="yn"></strong>", replied the <strong class="an-an"></strong> "but I get there <strong class="sel"></strong> than you think. I'll run you a race prove it."
        </p>

        <p>
        The <strong class="an"></strong> was much <strong class="adjec"></strong> at the idea of running a race with the <strong class="an-an"></strong>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <strong class="one-m"></strong>. who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<strong class="motivation"></strong>".

        </p>

         <p>
            The <strong class="an"></strong> was soon far out of sight,and to make the <strong class="an-an"></strong> feel very deeply how rediculous it was for him to try a race with a <strong class="an"></strong>. he went off the course to practice <strong class="verbing"></strong> for <strong class="numer"></strong> hours until the <strong class="an-an"></strong>  should catch up.
         </p>
        
         <p>
            The <strong class="an-an"></strong> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily. and, after a time, passed the place where the <strong class="an"></strong> was <strong class="verbing"></strong>  .The <strong class="an"></strong>  was so caught up in <strong class="verbing"></strong>; and when at last he did stop, the <strong class="an-an"></strong> was near the goal.The <strong class="an"></strong> now ran his swiftesy, but he could not overtake the <strong class="an-an"></strong>l in time.
         </p>
